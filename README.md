# PasswordGenerator
In this react-native project, I made a password generator app, which will take password length as an input and will let user select lowercase, uppercase,
numbers and symbols checkbox if they want to include that in the generated password. The password will be generated and displayed on screen which user can 
copy.
Libraries used - Formik, Yup, Bouncy checkbox.
